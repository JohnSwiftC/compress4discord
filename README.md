# compress4discord
Simple command line util for compressing videos to Discord standards (made quickly for friends)
# Creds
Shamelessly found some StackOverflow code here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64430805/how-to-compress-video-to-target-size-by-python
And then made changes to target discord and added commandline functionality.
# Installation IMPORTANT!!!!!
This will not work if you do not have ffmpeg installed! Install the three pre-compiled exes from here: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
and then PLACE INTO THE SAME FOLDER AS THE PYTHON SCRIPT!
# Usage
In cmd put the script name.py, then the full video path, and then the output name!
You guys will have to put 'python3' before that command off a fresh install! If that doesn't work, try just 'python' or 'py'!!
